# SVERKER
Sverker is an IRC bot created by Fr4sbokz/Frassefras and myself all the way back in 2010.
Written in C++, depends on SFML 1.6 (sfml-system and sfml-network is enough to build)

## Web Interface
Along with the bot comes a web interface (sverker.zip) where you can add triggers/commands for it to react to. (uses php and mysql)

This project is mostly for personal use and preservation of the source code. It will likely not be useful to you.
